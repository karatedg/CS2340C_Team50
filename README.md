# CS2340C_Team50

Welcome!

This was our project for Georgia Tech's Fall 2023 CS2340 class - Objects and Design. This class was focused mainly on the creation of this dungeon crawler game, developed using the agile development cycle. We also covered a variety of other useful techniques and information during the course of this class that guided our project development, including multiple diagram types, testing and test-driven development, git, code reviews, and a variety of design principles and patterns.

## Running the Game
We don't have an included apk file as the game was developed mainly to work inside of Android Studio. However, downloading this repository and launching it in android studio should allow you to play the game. We recommend running it on a pixel 3a virtual device as that is the profile we used for testing.
